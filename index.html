        <h2>Simple Nutrition Tips for Everyday Health</h2>

        <ul class="tips-list">
            <li>
                <strong>Don’t skip meals:</strong>
                Eating regularly helps maintain energy levels and prevents overeating later in the day.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Stay hydrated:</strong>
                Drinking enough water supports digestion, energy, and overall wellbeing.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Balance your plate:</strong>
                Include vegetables, protein, and whole grains for better nutrition.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Listen to your body:</strong>
                Eat when you’re hungry and stop when you’re satisfied.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Small changes matter:</strong>
                Consistent, simple habits lead to long-term health.
